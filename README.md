SwimPal App

The SwimPal app allows users to perform many tasks that swimmers would benefit from. Firstly users can create a personalized training plan based
on their current label and preferred strokes. Users will be presented with a workout for each day of the week they will train on
and each workout will have a series of exercises with guidance on swim intensity, stroke to be swam, repetitions and distance. After completion
of the workout data will be stored in the statistics section of the app, which users will be able to view. Users are also able to record their
swimming race times and categorize them by stroke, distance and time.
